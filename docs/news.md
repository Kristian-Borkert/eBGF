In March, the working group in eBGF were meeting up to attend our first writing sprint. The sprint was initiated by the German Association of the Internet Industry [eco](https://international.eco.de/about-eco/) and the Blockchain Lab from the [Institute for Internet Security â€“ if(is)](https://www.internet-sicherheit.de/). On three days, a group of up to 15 people were having a number of writing sessions on the RFCs for the eBGF, the eco Blockchain Governance Framework (eBGF). These condensed sessions lay the groundwork for the content on these websites.
