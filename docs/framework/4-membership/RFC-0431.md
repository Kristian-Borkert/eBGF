# RFC-0431: Onboarding process for new members

## Abstract

Admission process of new members taking into account the required criteria.
    
## Motivation

If all requirements are met, the admission process can be carried out after a decision by the consortium. In this process, permissions are granted and access to the project infrastructure is given. This process should be standardised. This depends on the level of authorisation that has been granted. The transfer of information and responsibilities must of course also be communicated. In the process, the own infrastructure is also integrated into the blockchain. This ensures that there are no problems with the inclusion and that the network can be expanded without any problems.
