# Offboarding

## Abstract

This section describes the exclusion or offboarding process of members taking into account the required criteria.
    
## Motivation

In the event of misconduct or other reasons for the expulsion of a member, this must be decided by a majority. It must be decided whether the member is suspended for a certain period of time or directly expelled. In this process, privileges must either be suspended for a period of time or withdrawn completely. This means that the member can no longer participate in the decision-making process and, in the case of an exclusion, can no longer access the project infrastructure. This is the only way to ensure that the restrictions take effect and that the infrastructure of the excluded member is no longer integrated into the infrastructure of the blockchain. This ensures that no problems can occur on the network.
