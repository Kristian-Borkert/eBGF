# RFC-0631 â€“ Decision-making (Onchain/offchain)

## Abstract

Processes for decision-making and guidelines on where these are carried out.
    
## Motivation

In order to be able to make decisions with all those involved, weightings of votes must be defined. In addition, it must also be defined when a majority is reached. Is more than half of the votes sufficient or is a higher majority required? What happens if the vote is not cast and how long does this process actually take? Information about an upcoming vote must also be regulated, as well as the announcement of the decision taken. Once these formalities have been clarified, the decision-making process can be carried out. It is important to establish processes that do not disadvantage others and are therefore fair and transparent. Furthermore, regulations are needed that concern decisions that do not flow into the blockchain. These decisions are usually executed through contracts and third parties. This is the only way to ensure that the consortium's decision-making is legal.
