# RFC-0611: Consortial Communication

## Abstract

Processes and tools for efficient and effective communication in the consortium.
    
## Motivation

In order to ensure good communication between all companies and partners, processes and tools are required to ensure that everyone is on the same page so that decisions can be made that are comprehensible. The decision-making process in particular can lead to wrong decisions and disadvantages if there is a lack of information and poor communication. It must be ensured that the process is always fair and transparent. In addition, it is of course also important who the contact persons of the individual companies are and how conflicts can be escalated. This is the only way to work efficiently and effectively with all those involved. Of course, guidelines are also important because each company has its own specifications and these are usually a barrier to communication with everyone. Therefore, decisions have to be made at the beginning which tools are possible for everyone so that communication can take place at all.
