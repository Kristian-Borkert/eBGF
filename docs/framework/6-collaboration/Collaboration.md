# Collaboration

## Abstract

Well defined processes and tools for collaboration, communication, conflict and knowledge sharing are essential for the efficient and smooth operation of the network.
    
## Motivation

For good collaboration, it is particularly important that all members are on the same level. Therefore, an infrastructure is needed in which everything is neatly documented and freely accessible. Work processes should be documented as well as the corresponding contact persons and their delegates. This ensures that communication can take place smoothly at all times. This must be possible beyond organisational boundaries. Consequently, the communication applications used must also cover and fulfil the policies of all participating organisations. Furthermore, policies for conflicts are needed to determine from the outset how to deal with them so that everyone is treated fairly and equally. This will also determine how to properly escalate a conflict so that the problem can be solved efficiently and effectively. This requires decision-making methods and voting procedures. Communication can create a sense of community that leads to better cooperation among all participants and benefits the project immensely. For these reasons, communication is so important and contributes to long-term success.   
    
## Elaboration

### Important starting points
The process should start with the definition of stakeholders and getting an overview of the way communication and responsibilities are handled at the consortium partners. The following points are taken from experience and may help:

- Discourse with the guidelines of the other consortium partners.

- Communication within the own company.

- Cooperation in the consortium is in conflict with the work in the company.

- Isolation used to be the guideline, now individual employees have to work together with outsiders.

- Virtual, cross-border IT technology is pitted against military organisation.

### Communication platforms
1. Primary collaboration platform 
- Project management
- Organisation of collaboration
- Decision making
- Minutes 

2. Chat-Communication
- Messages with organising purposes

3. DevOps platform (Gitlab)
- Technical information
- Code exchange
- Configuration files 
- Source code

4. Public publishing platform (extern)
- basic information
- blogging

### Policy 
It is important to note that a communication and collaboration policy consists of three layers:
definition of scope of the policy
definition of requirements in the policy
legal and compliance, defined by contracts (important parts may need to be secured by contract)

The actual implementation of such a policy will likely depend on the consortium as such, so we can only sketch out the way to get the final policy, not the final policy itself. The following sections describe the main steps in this process.

### Trust
It is important to build mutual trust, through transparency. 
(though implementing it may be in conflict with existing policies at the consortium members)

Point to keep in view in regard with collaboration and communication:

- Confidence
    - Ability
        - Employees
        - Technology
        - Organisation
    - ...
- Reliability
    - Sense of responsibility
    - IT systems
    - ...
- Certainty
    - Reputation 
    - ...
- Security

### Code of conduct 

- efficiency
- criticism

### Consens building

How to communicate about votes and decision
- Invitations to vote  
- Deadline / fallback 
- Communication of decision
- Publication of decision 

### Internal communication
- Debreifing of staff within one organisation
- Internal communication
- Bus driver problem 
- Substitute regulations 
- Admin rights


### Organigram

Communication partners need to be authorised or have an decision making process in place
- per field and topic

Then an organigramm should be defined for the consortium structure

- (Founding) members of the consortium
    - Requirements
- Executive board
    - Implementation
- Operational board (Admin, …)
    - Realisation
- Technical board (Strategy, ...)
- Financial/crypto-economic
- Advisory board
    - Advice / Recommendations              

### Main points to define 
The final communication and collaboration policy needs to answer the following questions:

- Who is the responsible contact person for external questions?

- Who is the contact person for technical problems within the chain?

- How can escalation take place in an emergency?

- Escalation across consortium borders

- Resource conflicts between consortium and member companies.

- Emergency communication channel?

- How to find the right contact persons?

- Decision-making bodies

- Expert bodies

- Working Admins

- Informal exchange

- Developing a sense of community

- Organisation of standby/call-out duties

- Distribute holiday organisation via consortium

- Sickness substitutions

- Mutual substitutions within the consortium (mutual root rights)

Using an exchange service with open access has potential risks of leaking information (credential, intellectual property). Also personalised data like contact information are shared with the public world and could be used to get access to the system.
