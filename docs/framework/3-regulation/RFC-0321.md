# RFC-0321: AML and KYC

## Abstract

(*1-2 sentences*)
This RFC describes the need for anti money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) procedures. Moreover, examples are given and explained on how to utilize these procedures for a blockchain network.
    
## Motivation

(*max. +- 2.000 characters, former “motivation” section*) 

KYC and AML are legitimacy checks that are used depending on the purpose of the blockchain network. KYC mechanisms are used to create compliance with laws.  Accordingly, the users of the network are to be identified in order to either simply prevent bots or spam or even clearly establish that it is a genuine identity. With a corresponding identity determination, money laundering can also be prevented, for example, when a cryptocurrency is used in the network.

    
## Elaboration

(*max. +- 5.000 characters*)

The KYC process used may vary depending on the confidence level of the identification. At a low-threshold level, for example, social media accounts [1] are sufficient for abuse prevention in the network. For other applications, especially identity-based applications such as a self-sovereign identity network, processes are required that can establish identities on the basis of ID cards or other official documents (with the help of the issuer). When using a currency in the network, identification as well as logging of transactions is required for applicable money laundering laws.
