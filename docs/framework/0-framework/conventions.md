## How to maintain the site

**Editing documents**

All documents are written in markdown. Edits only need to be commited and pushed, Github itself is already setup to automatically update the website based on those documents. If you want to edit the documents with your editor of choice use need to pull the repository. The GitHub Desktop Client should be the easiest option to do so.

**Numbering and naming**

Name new RFC according to the topic and a number fitting the category, e. g. a new RFC gets a 4 digit number, the first two digits define the category, the third digit the subcategory and the fourth digit the place in the sequence of documents within a subcategory. The name of the document should be short, distinct and recognizable.

*Please be sure to edit the mkdocs.yaml file once you create, delete or rename a document.*

*Also note if a document has no '# Title' the yaml file defines the title on the website, the navigation stays untouched by the markdown files.*
