## The eco Blockchain Governance Framework – eBGF

The eBGF will serve as an abstract collection of topics that need to be addressed in order to operate a professional, production-grade, public-permissioned blockchain network. 

The eBGF will offer structure, questions, considerations, thoughts, guidelines, links and recommendations for standards and best practices of technical implementations. It will document experiences regarding technical monitoring, hardware and software requirements, policies updates, backup and disaster recovery. It will describe the processes for off- and on-boarding of members into the network as well as proposing and executing changes to the governance itself, and it will address many more aspects.

However, it will not define a specific blockchain governance which defines answers to all issues of any blockchain governance. 

But addressing and locating issues of specific components on distinctive layers alone is a first step to finding solutions and improve the reliability and quality of the network and services. 

Addressing and locating issues of specific components on distinctive layers of a blockchain governance framework will also allow to evaluate and compare different networks protocols and governance models to each other and create greater transparency and trust in the blockchain networks of the future.
